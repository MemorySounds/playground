      <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
      <p>
        Robert is a dancer coming from a breaking background, who hasn’t wanted
        to do battles since he settled in Paris. Hugo worked as a dancer and
        choreographer until he settled in Paris, where he decided to step back
        from stage for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we both love dance, so we got along in our desire to find
        alternative ways of practicing it. Thus we started to organize
        PLAYGROUND sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert is also a music nerd, DJ, camera holder and avant-garde art
        lover. Hugo has worked on multidisciplinary projects at Beaux Arts de
        Toulouse and Architecture school of Montpellier, loves writing poetry
        and is interested in art performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        We both want to broaden our artistic practice to different media, and we
        wish to merge them into the PLAYGROUND sessions.
      </p>

      <h2>NEED FOR A SPACE</h2>
      <p>
        We often dance in the regular practice spots in Paris (Hall of Le 104,
        Gym at la Couronne, outdoor dance deck at La Villette). Shared spaces
        dedicated for dance practice. Well, we want to practice in a different
        way so we need a different place.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >We feel the need of intimacy, we desire a space to fully immerse
          into.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        So we now book slots in studios (Le Cinq, Shakirail) and invite a few
        people. Each and every time, we proceed to an ephemeral transformation
        of the space. We shape it with sounds. We paint it with movements. We
        craft it with scenography. We decorate it with props and costumes. We
        remold it according to the mood of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Before anything else, we aim to create an environment where we feel
          goooooood! Free from the unspoken rules of the conventional practice
          spots.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <h2>WHAT IS PRACTICE</h2>
      <p>
        The word practice usually refers to an activity that is carried out with
        the aim of achieving a result. To give the example we best know, dancers
        usually practice to refine moves and techniques. More specifically, most
        breakers practice to prepare for battles, most house dancers practice to
        dance at house-dance parties, most contemporary dancers practice to
        create/rehearse for shows. In all of those examples, the intention of
        the practice sessions is external to the session itself., which is to
        say, the practice is seen a means to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what happens to a practice session whenever it is devoid of
        intention? This is the question we are trying to raise through the
        PLAYGROUND sessions. There is no productive goal in this practice, no
        battle to prepare, no show to rehearse, no move to unlock, no skills to
        improve. We practice for the practice itself. We practice because it
        makes us feel alive. We practice because we love it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every practice is different. We try to listen to our own internal state.
        To do according to our moods. To do nothing if that’s how we feel. To be
        the spectator. To be the performer.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be mentioned that, of course, PLAYGROUND sessions also have
        outcomes: it can happen that one’s would develop new technique, create
        material or even that the session itself turn into an improvised
        performance. But those are only outcomes, not goals, since we enter the
        session without - as much as possible - intentions. This is an important
        point since our current context where hyper-productivity is seen as the
        highest virtue in modern society.

        PLAY AS A TOOL TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INTENTIONALITY OF OUR SESSIONS
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here I would like to share some thoughts on play and how it can be a
        useful reference for our sessions.
